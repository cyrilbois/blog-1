## Advantages vs Drawbacks

* Each service is isolated -> Configuration/Deployment can be complex
* Boundaries via APIs -> No language level communication. Need API calls
* Developing single service is faster -> Cross-service changes are harder
* Testing single service is easier -> Integration testing is harder
* Maintenance of a single service easier but adds up for maintaining many different services
* More failure resilient
* Easier/Cheaper to scale
