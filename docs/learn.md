## Developer ToDos in 2019

* New ECMA features. Check [node green]https://node.green/() for things you can use in node
* More work with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* Perhaps switch to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Try using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with [GraphCool](https://www.graph.cool/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) or [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)

### ToDos

Themes are Code-Quality (Testing, Documentation), REST alternatives and Client-Side frameworks. As big part of testing in JS is type-checking, using TypeScript could be considered a part of testing.

* [x] Start using JDoc on all code.
* [] Get basic knowledge on TypeScript
* [] Start using TS for Node development and implement Node/Hapi template using TS
* [] Create a server-template for using GraphQL using Hapi/Apollo
* [] As v3 of Vue will be implemented with TS start looking at that after they have shipped or when time allows.


## Developer ToDos in 2018

* Use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) or [Standard](https://standardjs.com/) for code linting and formatting
* New ECMA features. Check [node green]https://node.green/() for things you can use in node
* Use hapi 17, Node 8 , async/await
* Using Node 8+ objects and arrays has .includes() function
