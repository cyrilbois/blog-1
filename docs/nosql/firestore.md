Cloud Firestore is a NoSQL document-based database built for mobile and web app development. It does the same things Firebase does:

1. Allows you to access data directly in the client - serverless
2. The accessed data is updated realtime
3. Makes it easy to build offline experiences

Realtime DB -> Sync app state in realtime with low latency

Firestore addresses the following firebase issues:

* RTDB can't query over multiple properties. This is typically handled by duplicating data or filtering in client.
* RTDB does not scale automatically. Cloud Firestore does.
