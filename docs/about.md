## ToDos

Themes are Code-Quality (Testing, Documentation), REST alternatives and Client-Side frameworks. As big part of testing in JS is type-checking, using TypeScript could be considered a part of testing.

* Start using JDoc or alternative on all code.
* Get basic knowledge on TypeScript
* Start using TS for Node development and implement Node/Hapi template using TS
* Create a server-template for using GraphQL using Hapi/Apollo
* As v3 of Vue will be implemented with TS start looking at that after they have shipped or when time allows.

## Ongoing Learning

* [GraphQL](./misc/graphql.md)
* [Node Microservices](./misc/microservices.md)
* [All About NodeJS on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/all-about-nodejs/) for Express to compare.


## Developer ToDos in 2019

* New ECMA features. Check [node green](https://node.green/) for things you can use in node
* More work with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
* Perhaps switch to [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* Try using [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) with [GraphCool](https://www.graph.cool/), [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) or [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/)
